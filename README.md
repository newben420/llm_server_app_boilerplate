# Express-Expo-Groq BoilerPlate
Just an express-expo-groq boilerplate to build several AI-wrapper/AI-extended applications on with background authentications ensuring easy-onboarding while preventing API abuse.

## Features
1. Extend-friendly background "login-less" device-based smart authentication (identifies every unique installation) that can be used to authorize valid users, send push notifications, and protect selected API endpoints.

2. GroqEngine, a full smart Groq API driver that handles rate limiting, model selection, queuing, priorities, among others.

3. UI-Ready Expo app enhanced with AppBar, Bottom Navigation, Theming, and Localization (with language selection). Also with ready-to-use SQLite integration.

4. Mysql DB schema for server to store Device IDs, Push Tokens, e.t.c., which can be extended for various other purpose.

5. Other features can be discovered when the code is scanned.
